# Automated Theorem Prover

It was an exploratory **self-study** to learn about Theorem Provers and Turing Completeness.

This was part of the Big Data Architecture course during my Masters in Data Science at University of Colorado Boulder, Spring 2022.
The Big Data Architecture course only focusses on deployment, cloud environments and developing apis along with industry best practices.

## Background

### The presentation:

[ Theorem Prover Presentation](https://github.com/sushmaakoju/demo-automated-theorem-prover/blob/main/Theorem%20Prover.pdf)

### Hosted Website for Automated Theorem Prover

[Automated Theorem Prover examples: https://automatedtheoremprover.uw.r.appspot.com/](https://automatedtheoremprover.uw.r.appspot.com/)

#### Modules:
1. Includes Microsoft Z3 Solver and Prover
2. Includes Basic Theorem Prover (Entscheidungsproblem)
3. Work-in-progress: Logical Neural Networks (LNNs) - Solving Natural Language + First Order Logic over Logical Neural Networks (LNNs)

#### About the project:

The modules for demonstrating Big Data Architecture were selected 
based on my learning as well as past work experience along with the intent to 
research further as well as with the intent to publish.
Thus the implementation is not directly provided here due to possible research and publication goals.

##### Sub tasks for the project:

This project demonstrates proof-of-concept implementation of following modules:

### Z3 Prover (Microsoft Research)

- [Z3 Prover Examples Colab Notebook](https://github.com/sushmaakoju/demo-ATLS5214/blob/main/z3_prover_examples.ipynb)

*Pending approval from researcher for replication*
- This is a theorem prover using first order logic statements from natural language corpus using Recurrent Neural Networks.

### Logical Neural Networks (LNNs)

- Adapting an example using LNN Python API : <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/LNN">Reasoning & First Order Logic in LNNs </a>
- with LNN Module, Predicates, Propositions
