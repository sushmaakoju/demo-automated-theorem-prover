# Demo : Automated Theorem Prover
It was an exploratory study to learn about Theorem Provers and Turing Completeness, which was part of the course during my Masters in Data Science at University of Colorado Boulder, Spring 2022.

## Course project for Big Data Arhchitecture ATLS 5214

## Background

#### This project is for demonstrating the concepts from Big Data Arhcitecture class: Google Cloud

#### The website and presentation:

[Automated Theorem Prover examples: https://automatedtheoremprover.uw.r.appspot.com/](https://automatedtheoremprover.uw.r.appspot.com/)

[ Theorem Prover Presentation](https://github.com/sushmaakoju/demo-automated-theorem-prover/blob/main/Theorem%20Prover.pdf)


#### About the project:

The modules for demonstrating Big Data Architecture were selected 
based on my learning as well as past work experience along with the intent to 
research further as well as with the intent to publish.
Thus the implementation is not directly provided here due to possible research and publication goals.

##### Sub tasks for the project:

This project demonstrates proof-of-concept implementation of following modules:

*Basics from AIMA, 4th edition*
- Simple mathematical theorem prover represented in symbols

- Theorem prover for first of order logic statements from brute force parser for the grammar. <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/first-order-logic/tree/86cde01c6d03fa39e6cdd4b50c26339211e19adf"> First Order Logic</a>
- First order logic conversion using brute force approach. <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/first-order-logic/tree/86cde01c6d03fa39e6cdd4b50c26339211e19adf"> First Order Logic</a></strike>
- <strike>Natural Language Inference Engine using a Language Model. <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/natural-language-inference/tree/1d5445a27b401c772d78c0ca6113b8d3783f0780"> NLI</a> </strike>

### Z3 Prover (Microsoft Research)
- [Z3 Prover Examples Colab Notebook](https://github.com/sushmaakoju/demo-ATLS5214/blob/main/z3_prover_examples.ipynb)

*Pending approval from researcher for replication*
- This is a theorem prover using first order logic statements from natural language corpus.
